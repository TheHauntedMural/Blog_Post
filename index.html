                        <p>Have you ever read a book and felt a sense of déjà vu, as if you've encountered similar themes or characters before? Chances are, you've experienced intertextuality - a fancy term for the way texts refer to or build upon other texts. It's like a literary game of telephone, where stories and ideas evolve as they pass from one writer to another.</p>

                        <h2>What is Intertextuality?</h2>
                        <p>At its core, intertextuality is about connections. It's the literary equivalent of a conversation between books, where authors nod to their predecessors, challenge old ideas, or reimagine classic tales. This technique isn't just clever wordplay; it's a powerful tool that adds depth and resonance to literature.</p>

                        <h2>Modernism and Postmodernism: A Tale of Two Eras</h2>
                        <p>To understand how intertextuality shapes modern writing, we need to take a quick trip through two major literary movements: modernism and postmodernism.</p>

                            <div class="book-era">
                                <h3>Modernism</h3>
                                <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Stream of consciousness, fragmented reality</p>
                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Mrs. Dalloway" by Virginia Woolf</p>
                                <p>Woolf dives deep into Clarissa's thoughts, giving us a fragmented, non-linear glimpse into her mind.</p>

                            <div class="book-era">
                                <h3>Postmodernism</h3>
                                <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Playing with reality and truth, meta-narratives</p>
                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "The Hours" by Michael Cunningham</p>
                                <p>A conversation with Woolf's work, weaving together three interconnected stories.</p>

                        <h2>Intertextuality in Action: "Mrs. Dalloway" and "The Hours"</h2>
                        <p>Let's look at how Cunningham uses intertextuality to create something new from Woolf's classic:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Character Echoes:</strong> Cunningham's Clarissa Vaughan mirrors Woolf's Clarissa Dalloway, but with modern twists.</li>
                            <li><strong>Thematic Resonance:</strong> Both novels explore themes of mental health, the passage of time, and societal expectations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Structural Similarities:</strong> Cunningham mimics Woolf's stream-of-consciousness style, adapting it for a postmodern audience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Direct References:</strong> Cunningham incorporates Woolf herself as a character, blurring the lines between fiction and reality.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </section>

                    <section class="sidebar">
                        <h2>Why Does Intertextuality Matter?</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adds depth to writing</li>
                            <li>Creates dialogue between texts</li>
                            <li>Challenges readers</li>
                            <li>Evolves ideas across time</li>

                        <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
                        <p>Next time you're reading a book and feel that sense of familiarity, pay attention. You might be witnessing intertextuality in action. It's a reminder that literature, like all art, doesn't exist in a vacuum. Each story is part of a grand, ongoing conversation - and we, as readers, get to listen in.</p>
                        <p>So, dive into that next novel with open eyes and an open mind. Who knows what literary echoes you might hear?</p>
